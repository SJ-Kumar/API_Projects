#### API architecture refers to the design of an API and how it is organized. It encompasses the structure of an API and how it is built, including the endpoints, methods, and parameters.
There are a few different types of API architectures that developers can use to create APIs.

The most popular type of API architecture is the REST API.

Other popular types of API architectures include SOAP, XML-RPC, and JSON-RPC.

1. REST

A REST (Restful) API is a web service that uses HTTP requests (GET, PUT, POST, and DELETE) to manipulate data. 

A REST API can access resources such as HTML pages, images, and other resources identified by a URL.

2. SOAP

SOAP API refers to the application programming interface for communication in Simple Object Access Protocol. 

It defines the rules and standards for how two applications can interact with each other over the internet. 

This type of API is often used in web services.

3.  RPC

RPC stands for Remote Procedure Call Application Programming Interface.

It is a platform-independent communications protocol that allows different software components to communicate with each other.

RPC API is based on the concept of remote procedure calls, which allows a program to execute a procedure or function on a remote machine as if it were local.

Let's show the two most famous examples.

3.1 XML-RPC 

XML-RPC is a remote procedure call system that uses XML to encode its calls and HTTP as a transport mechanism. 

It is designed to be simple and extensible.

3.2 JSON-RPC

JSON-RPC is a remote procedure call protocol encoded in JSON. 

It is a simple and lightweight protocol that allows for accessible communication between computers.

curl is nothing but a command-line tool that provides a more programmatic way to interact with APIs.
curl stands for client URL.

It is used to establish communication between the client and the server.

You can fetch data and transfer data to the server using curl.

The latest modern OS has to curl pre-installed, so you don't need to install it to work with it.

Or you can install it from here:

https://curl.se/download.html
Working with curl is super fast and convenient.

Open your terminal and run the following command.

`curl --version` 

It will give you the version of curl you're currently using.

A typical HTTP request has four different components:

- Method
- Endpoint
- HTTP headers
- Body

You can pass all of these using curl.
